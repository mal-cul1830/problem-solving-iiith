A version control system or VCS, also know as revision control or source control system, is a software utility that tracks and manages changes to a filesystem. A VCS also offers collaborative utilities to share and integrate these filesystem changes to other VCS users. When operating at the filesystem level, a VCS will track the addition, deletion, and modification actions applied to files and directories. A repository is a VCS term which describes when VCS is tracking a filesystem. In the scope of individual source code files, a VCS will track additions, deletions, modifications of the lines of text within that file. Popular software industry VCS options include Git, Mercurial, SVN and preforce.
